In this light, the State has adopted the Philippine Agenda 21 framework\nGOVPH (/)\nwhich espouses sustainable development, to ful\udbc0\udca0ll human needs while maintaining the quality\nof the natural environment for current and future generations.\nTowards this end, the State adopts the principle of protecting the climate system for the bene\udbc0\udca0t\nof humankind, on the basis of climate justice or common but differentiated responsibilities and\nthe Precautionary Principle to guide decision-making in climate risk management. As a party to\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the State adopts the\nultimate objective of the Convention which is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations\nin the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the\nclimate system which should be achieved within a time frame suf\udbc0\udca0cient to allow ecosystems to\nadapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable\neconomic development to proceed in a sustainable manner. As a party to the Hyogo Framework\nfor Action, the State likewise adopts the strategic goals in order to build national and local\nresilience to climate change-related disasters.\nRecognizing the vulnerability of the Philippine archipelago and its local communities, particularly\nthe poor, women, and children, to potential dangerous consequences of climate change and\nglobal warming such as increasing temperatures, rising seas, changing landscapes, increasing\nfrequency and/or severity of droughts, \udbc0\udca0re, \udbc0\udca1oods and storms, climate-related illnesses and\ndiseases, damage to ecosystems, biodiversity loss that affect the country\u2019s environment, culture,\nand economy, the State shall cooperate with the global community in the resolution of climate\nchange issues, including disaster risk reduction. It shall be the policy of the State to enjoin the\nparticipation of national and local governments, businesses, nongovernment organizations, local\ncommunities and the public to prevent and reduce the adverse impacts of climate change and, at\nthe same time, maximize the potential bene\udbc0\udca0ts of climate change. It shall also be the policy of\nthe State to incorporate a gender-sensitive, pro-children and pro-poor perspective in all climate\nchange and renewable energy efforts, plans and programs. In view thereof, the State shall\nstrengthen, integrate, consolidate and institutionalize government initiatives to achieve\ncoordination in the implementation of plans and programs to address climate change in the\ncontest of sustainable development.\nFurther recognizing that climate change and disaster risk reduction and management are closely\ninterrelated and effective disaster risk reduction and management will enhance adaptive\ncapacity to climate change, climate variability and extreme climate events, the State shall\nintegrate disaster risk reduction into climate change programs and initiatives.\nCognizant of the need to ensure that national and sub-national government policies, plans,\nprograms and projects are founded upon sound environmental considerations and the principle\nof sustainable development, it is hereby declared the policy of the State to systematically\nintegrate the concept of climate change in various phases of policy formulation, development\nplans, poverty reduction strategies and other development tools and techniques by all agencies\nand instrumentalities of the government.\u201d",
