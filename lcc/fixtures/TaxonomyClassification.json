The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement adopted decisions on the Biennial Transparency Reports (BRT) which will provide a framework for Parties to provide the national inventory reports and the information necessary to track progress in implementing and achieving NDCs, as well as information on climate change impacts and adaptation mandated under Article 7 of the Paris Agreement.  Developed country Parties are also to provide information pursuant to Article 13, paragraph 9. The first BRT and inventory reports are to be submitted by 2024.",

Land-use planning is driven by the need for (i) improved management, and (ii) a different pattern of land use, as dictated by changing circumstances. Typically, a land use plan (LUP) offers a framework for overall land and environmental management, which includes forested lands, and which determines resource allocation, cross sectoral linkages and institutional coordination. A LUP (at national or subnational levels, depending on the context) can also be a vehicle for the promotion of sustainable land use management, the conservation of forest resources and carbon sinks, and for increasing tenure security by recognising and protecting customary and indigenous tenure rights. A LUP will also increase accountability and provide a sound basis for the resolution of tenure-related disputes. These are all elements that contribute to the improvement of livelihoods and food security, which in turn are prerequisites for a successful implementation of climate strategies. Countries will often enact a LUP through passing a piece of legislation, which gives it greater legal force. \r\n\r\nFor further information, refer to: http://www.fao.org/sustainable-forest-management/toolbox/modules/land-use-planning/basic-knowledge/en/?type=111",

This Article also gave a treaty-based legal anchor to the Warsaw Framework for REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries), which was adopted at COP 19.\u00a0Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is an example of results-based payments that has been gaining support as a promising tool for the promotion of sustainable practices. PES involves payments to land or other natural resource owners in return for a guaranteed flow of ecosystem services or certain actions likely to enhance their provision over and above what would otherwise be provided in the absence of payment.\r\n\r\nFor further information see:\r\nhttp://www.undp.org/content/sdfinance/en/home/solutions/payments-for-ecosystem-services.html",

For example, legislation can require that certain measures, such as farming a wider variety of species or introducing new or better-adapted strains, be incorporated into a fisheries management plan or, if applicable, in an aquaculture management plan. Further, requirements that flooded land unsuitable for agriculture be used for aquaculture, or that former rice farming areas unsuitable for further farming due to salt intrusion be repurposed for shrimp farming, or prohibitions on fish farming in areas prone to sea-level rise, can be introduced through technical regulations issued under agricultural zoning laws or under specific aquaculture zoning laws, if these exist. Mitigation measures can include supporting the reduction of energy intensive feedstuffs, requirements for climate sensitive feed management and, where appropriate, integration of pond aquaculture with agriculture. Such measures can also be integrated into fisheries and aquaculture management plans.",

    "details": "Feed management practices play a significant role in the environmental impacts of a farming operation. Overfeeding, for example, is a major cause of excess nutrients entering the environment, and can cause reduced feed efficiencies, increased waste and environmental degradation. Poor feed handling, storage and spoilage prior to ingestion will result in poor feed efficiencies and increased environmental degradation. Selecting feedstuffs with lower associated emissions such as locally-sourced oilseeds, which produce much lower emissions than fishmeal and fish oil sourced from capture fisheries, can lower the carbon footprint of a farming operation. In addition, technical specifications on the content of feed (e.g. drugs) may be introduced. Such measures may be specified in technical regulations issued under primary aquaculture legislation and may be included in a licensing /permit system for aquaculture operations.",

Such measures can be implemented by a Biosecurity Authority, including Port (air and sea) authorities with quarantine facilities. Legislative measures can regulate the import and export of fish, set minimum sanitary requirements, set import health standards, prescribe penalties, grant emergency powers to biosecurity officials to deal with any incursions of contaminated or invasive species, which may include prohibiting harvesting of fish, and stipulate measures for dealing with dead or diseased fish. Aquaculture legislation or, if this does not exist, primary fisheries legislation, can also introduce reporting requirements on fish health, i.e. on aquatic animal and plant (e.g. seaweed) disease to the appropriate authority.",
